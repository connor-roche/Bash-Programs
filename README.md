# Bash Programs
Four simple bash scripts that do not include built-in bash commands.

1) count.sh - builds a table of counters for the commands under /bin in alphabetical order.
2) reverse.sh - reverses the contents of a directory passed as a parameter using two functions.
3) filter.sh - prints those files/directories that have the size greater than the average file size of the directory.
4) insert-sort.sh - sorts a list of command line parameters in ascending order.
